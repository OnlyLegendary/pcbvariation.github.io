      <h1>Projects I actually built</h1>
      <p>
        This is my personal engineering portfolio. I mess with PCB design, embedded
        firmware, and real prototypes you can hold. I like showing what worked, what
        didn’t, and why I made the choices I did.

        <h2>Battery Logger Board</h2>
        <p>
          I needed a tiny board that could read cell voltage, temperature, and log data
          on the go. I built the PCB in KiCad, routed the power stuff by hand, and wrote
          the firmware to sleep most of the time so the battery lasts.

        <h2>USB-C Sensor Hub</h2>
        <p>
          A small board that fans out USB-C power to a bunch of sensors and reads them
          over I2C. I had to make sure the layout didn’t get noisy, so I split the ground
          planes and kept the traces short.

        <h2>Desk Test Fixture</h2>
        <p>
          I got tired of plugging in probes, so I made a pogo-pin test fixture for quick
          checks. It has a simple microcontroller that shows pass/fail and dumps serial
          logs to my laptop.

        <h2>Motor Driver Rev B</h2>
        <p>
          My first motor driver ran hot, so I rebuilt it with thicker traces, a better
          gate driver, and some airflow cutouts in the enclosure. It runs cooler and
          doesn’t freak out at higher current.
