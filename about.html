      <h1>About PCB Variation</h1>
      <p>
        Basically, I’m working on a hardware-based security system that ties software to real physical hardware, not just keys or cloud auth.

Instead of trusting passwords or licenses that can be copied, I use how a device actually behaves. Every PCB and chip has tiny physical differences—timing, noise, drift, stuff you can’t fake in software. I measure those differences over time, not just once, and that becomes a fingerprint for that exact piece of hardware.

The important part is that this fingerprint comes from physics. You can’t clone it, you can’t emulate it properly, and you can’t just copy it onto another machine. If the hardware isn’t the same, it won’t match.

        <h2>What assembly bounty means</h2>
        <p>
          when my pcb board is actually built and tested, i can get proof it works. The bounty part
          is when the hardware  helps verify the assembly so the work i did can be trusted.

        <h2>Temporal physical fingerprinting</h2>
        <p>
          I measure tiny timing and analog shifts that happen as a board warms up, cools
          down, and gets older. That time-based drift is the fingerprint thing im trying to figure out.

        <h2>Why I’m doing this</h2>
        <p>
          Counterfeits and fake builds are a real thing. I want a cheap, repeatable way
          to prove a board is legit using this thing im making .

      <ol>
        <li><strong>design the test and pcb.</strong> pick signals and lines that differentiate</li>
        <li><strong>Build the pcb .</strong> Same design, different boards .</li>
        <li><strong>write down the data.</strong> hopefully get enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Analyze the drifting in the pcb.</strong> Find the patterns that stay unique so it cant be copyed or it fails.</li>
        <li><strong>Prove (abtpp) works.</strong> send it to people and make it known.</li>
