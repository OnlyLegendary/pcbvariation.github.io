      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a teen who keeps building hardware because it’s the fastest way to learn.
        I design PCBs, write firmware, and make prototypes that actually run on my desk.
        If something fails, I poke at it until I figure out why.

        <h2>How I work</h2>
        <p>
          I start with the problem, sketch the circuit, then jump into KiCad. I keep my
          layouts simple and label everything so future-me doesn’t get lost. Once the
          board shows up, I solder it, flash the code, and test it with a multimeter and
          a cheap scope.

        <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted a place to document what I’m building, not just post pretty photos.
          I’ll share the weird issues, the quick fixes, and what I learned so other
          people can steal the good ideas.

        <h2>What I’m into</h2>
        <p>
          Power electronics, sensors, tiny boards that do big stuff, and clean firmware
          that doesn’t waste cycles. If it has wires and a microcontroller, I’m probably
          interested.

        <li><strong>Sketch it.</strong> Figure out the job, then draw the circuit and block diagram.</li>
        <li><strong>Route it.</strong> Keep traces short, power clean, and labels obvious.</li>
        <li><strong>Solder it.</strong> Build it fast, then stare at it until it works.</li>
        <li><strong>Break it.</strong> Push it on purpose so I know the limits.</li>
        <li><strong>Fix it.</strong> Rev the board, clean the firmware, repeat.</li>
